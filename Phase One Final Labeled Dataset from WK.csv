2485868,Acevedo v. City of Philadelphia,161281,Frazier v. Simmons,"Defendant cites to a series of federal cases wherein courts found that police officers and other public safety officials who are unable to perform certain physical job functions, such as physically restraining others or discharging a weapon, are not “qualified individuals” under the disabilities laws. (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 11-15.) All of these eases, however, made a determination, on the basis of the facts and evidence before the court at the time, that no genuine issue of fact existed as to the essential functions of the police officer positions in question. See, e.g., Frazier v. Simmons, 254 F.3d 1247, 1259-60 (10th Cir.2001) (finding that multiple physical requirements for police officer were essential functions where the written job description listed these multiple physical requirements and plaintiff had no probative contrary evidence)...On the other hand, Defendant fails to acknowledge the similar multitude of cases that have declined to make a factual determination of the essential functions of a police officer position where probative, contradictory evidence was presented to the court. ",Neutral,"The court cited Frazier for illustrative purposes--as an example of a case cited by the defense that reached a conclusion where there was no genuine issue of fact regarding the essential functions of the job position in question. Frazier's factual scenario is different from the one presented in Acevedo, however, so it is not applicable. This is neither a positive nor negative treatment."
2485868,Acevedo v. City of Philadelphia,668232,"Fedro v. Janet Reno, 1 Attorney General of the United States","As to Plaintiffs third point — 'that he worked successfully in a limited duty position for two years — courts have held that the mere fact that a plaintiff is able to perform the responsibilities of a limited duty position, even over an extended period, does not make that plaintiff a “qualified individual” under the Rehabilitation Act. Luckiewicz, 670 F.Supp.2d at 408-09. Under the Act, an employer need not create positions specifically for the handicapped employee. Shiring, 90 F.3d at 831 (citing Fedro v. Reno, 21 F.3d 1391, 1395 (7th Cir.1994)). Thus, the fact that Plaintiff worked at a light duty position for two years in which he was not required to carry a firearm does not bear oh whether or not the carrying of a firearm is an “essential function” of a police officer position. 4 Nor must the Court consider an otherwise non-existent position as an accommodation that would make Plaintiff qualified.",Positive,"Cited to support a statement of law. The court then applies the two cited decisions (including Fedro) to support its conclusion (indicated partly by the use of the term ""Thus,"") that the fact that the employee worked for two years in a light duty position had no bearing on whether carrying a firearm was an ""essential function"" of a police officer position."
769160,"Marinelli v. City of Erie, Pennsylvania",2341728,"Thompson v. Dot Foods, Inc.","Further, in Baulos v. Roadway Express, Inc., 139 F.3d 1147 (7th Cir. 1998), a plaintiff who suffered from kidney troubles that prevented him from sleeping inside a truck claimed that he was substantially limited in his ability to work as a truck driver. See id. The evidence, however, showed that the plaintiff 's impairment only disqualified him from trucking positions that involved overnight travel, and therefore, the plaintiff could perform the majority of other trucking positions. See id. at 1153. The Baulos court thus held that the plaintiff was not disabled. See id.; see also Thompson v. Dot Foods, Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d 622, 626 (C.D. Ill. 1998) (holding plaintiff truck driver to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working in case in which plaintiff had submitted evidence establishing that he could not perform any trucking position involving road travel). In the present appeal, the evidence -- viewed in the light most favorable to Marinelli -- indicates only that Marinelli's injury precluded him from driving the type of snow plow utilized by the City. He has not introduced any evidence to suggest that his injury would hamper an attempt to obtain a position driving any other truck utilized by any employer -- including the City. ",Positive,"This is listed as a second example--following a previous citation to a Seventh Circuit decision, which is a same-level court. Thompson was likely included because it also involved a truck driver (Marinelli was working as a truck driver). Therefore, I've marked it as positive because it is supportive of the legal position, as well as how that might apply to the facts."
8767670,Brooklyn Center for Independence of Disabled v. Bloomberg,8751032,Dupler v. Costco Wholesale Corp.,"Plaintiffs have met this burden.  To be sure, the class members have diverse disabilities and will not all be affected by the alleged omissions in the City’s plan the same way.2  But “[c]ommonality does not mandate that all class members make identical claims and arguments, only that common issues of fact or law affect all class members.”  Stinson v. City of N.Y., 282 F.R.D. 360, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Trief v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 144 F.R.D. 193, 198 (S.D.N.Y. 1992)); s ee also Port Auth. Police Benevolent Ass’n v. Port Auth., 698 F.2d 150, 153-54 (2d Cir. 1983)).

Costco Wholesale Corp., 249 F.R.D. 29, 37 (E.D.N.Y. 2008)).  Here, at issue is a City-wide policy and its alleged failure to take into account the needs of disabled citizens.  This issue is common to the proposed class because it challenges “acts and omission of the [City] that are not specific to any particular Plaintiff.”  Raymond, 220 F.R.D. at 180; see alsoHenrietta D. v. Giuliani, No. 95 Civ. 0641 (SJ), 1996 WL 633382, at *14 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 1996)).  Accordingly, the commonality requirement has been met.",Neutral,"The only reason Dupler is cited here is because language from it was used by Stinson.

2113004,Hastings v. Papillion-LaVista School District,150068,"Wisbey v. City of Lincoln, Neb.","To show that one is disabled under federal law, an individual must show that she: (1) has a physical, sensory, or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). Under the “regarded as” prong, a person may be disabled under the ADA if, notwithstanding the absence of an actual disability, he is perceived or “regarded as” having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Weber v. Strippit, Inc., 186 F.3d 907, 914 (8th Cir.1999). Under the ADA, “the ‘regarded as’ provision was established to combat ‘archaic attitudes, erroneous perceptions, and myths’ working to the disadvantage of the disabled or perceived disabled.” Wisbey v. City of Lincoln, 612 F.3d 667, 672-73 (8th Cir.2010) (quoting Brunko v. Mercy Hosp., 260 F.3d 939, 942 (8th Cir.2001)).
Working has been recognized as a major life activity. See Breitkreutz v. Cambrex Charles City, Inc., 450 F.3d 780, 784 (8th Cir.2006); Nuzum v. Ozark Auto. Distrib., 432 F.3d 839, 844 (8th Cir.2005); Webner v. Titan Distrib., Inc., 267 F.3d 828, 834-35 (8th Cir.2001); Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Amer., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 949 (8th Cir.1999). “ ‘In order to be regarded as disabled with respect to the major life activity of working, the employer must mistakenly believe that [an] actual impairment substantially limits the employee’s ability to work.’ ” Wisbey, 612 F.3d at 672 (quoting Chalfant v. Titan Distribution, Inc., 475 F.3d 982, 989 (8th Cir.2007)). A substantial limitation on the major life activity of working means that an individual must be “significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i). The test is whether the defendant treated an employee adversely because it regarded the employee as having an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Weber, 186 F.3d at 915; Kellogg, 233 F.3d at 1089.
Under the law in effect at the time of the plaintiffs termination, the terms “major life activities” and “substantial limita *964 tion” were interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled. 3 Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002) (abrogated by statute in Pub. L. 110-325 (2008)); accord Ristrom v. Asbestos Workers Local Sk Joint Apprentice Comm., 370 F.3d 763, 768 (8th Cir.2004). Courts were to consider the nature, severity, duration, and long-term impact of the impairment when deciding whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Wood v. Crown Redi-Mix, Inc., 339 F.3d 682, 685 (2003). The impairment also had to be of an extended or permanent duration. Williams, 534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681.",Positive,"In this instance, Wisbey is cited for two purposes and both support the court's conclusion."

Independent School District No. 11,"[The 'regarded as' prong of § 12102(1)] shall not apply to impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less.”). Because the plaintiff was terminated prior to January 1, 2009, the ADAAA does not apply to her. Nyrop v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 11, 616 F.3d 728, 734 (8th Cir.2010).",Positive,"Here, the court follows the Eighth Circuit's conclusion in Nyrop (which in turn relied on sister courts) for the conclusion that the ADAAA of 2008 was not retroactive and was inapplicable to the plaintiff's claims."

Industrial Coils, Inc.","To survive NYL’s summary judgment motion, Henderson must meet the threshold burden of establishing that she is disabled under the statute. Roth v. Lutheran General Hosp., 57 F.3d 1446, 1454 (7th Cir.1995); Schluter v. Industrial Coils, Inc., 928 F.Supp. 1437, 1443 (W.D.Wis.1996). A diagnosis is relevant to determining whether a charging party has an impairment. It is important to remember, however, that a diagnosis may be insufficient to determine if the charging party has a disability. An impairment rises to ? the level of a disability when it substantially limits one or more major life activities____Further, a characteristic predisposition to illness or disease is not an impairment. 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. sec. 1630.2(h); Patrick v. Southern Co. Services, 910 F.Supp. 566, 568 (N.D.Ala.1996), aff'd, 103 F.3d 149 (11th Cir.1996)......
Henderson has provided no evidence that she has been substantially limited in. her ability to work. Indeed, she has testified that she is able to perform her job notwithstanding her CVIDD. Henderson Depo. pp. 119-120. She provides no evidence of the number of times she has been absent as a result of getting ill due to having CVIDD, nor how long it took for her to recuperate each time. 14 See e.g., Schluter v. Industrial Coils, Inc., 928 F.Supp. 1437, 1446 (W.D.Wis.1996) (Plaintiff must show her diabetes substantially limits her in a major life activity by showing that it affects her in fact, rather than how it would affect her hypothetically if she were unable to obtain insulin.....Plaintiffs evidence of insulin reactions is too vague to be significantly probative.

2418498,Jamison v. Dow Chemical Co.,773421,Kiphart v. Saturn Corporation,"There can be little question that seeing constitutes an important, major life activity. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (defining major life activities as “functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working”) (emphasis added). Likewise, the defendant does not seriously dispute the proposition that the plaintiffs eye disease, which affects his vision, is a “physical impairment.” See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(1) (2001) (stating that a “physical impairment” is “[a]ny physiological disorder, or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting [certain] body systems”). The assessment of whether such an impairment constitutes a “substantial limitation” is more complicated: it “ultimately requires an individualized, fact-specific inquiry into the effect of an impairment on a plaintiffs life.” Kiphart v. Saturn Corp., 251 F.3d 573, 582 (6th Cir.2001) (citing Sutton v. United Air Lines, 527 U.S. 471, 483, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999)).",Positive,The court cites Kiphart as a way of explaining need for the individualized inquiry that it performs.
3190737,"Scruggs v. Pulaski County, Arkansas",174213,Kirkeberg v.

See Kirkeberg v. Can. Pac. Ry., 619 F.3d 898, 907–08 (8thCir. 2010)(making a request for a reasonable accommodation is protected activity). Scruggs asserts the timing of her termination shows a causal connection between her protected activity and the county’s adverse employment action. As we have concluded, however, Scruggs’s request for additional time to obtain a new FMLA certification was not a reasonable accommodation, and therefore it was not protected activity. See Kirkeberg, 619 F.3dat907–08. As a result, Scruggs has failed to present a submissible case of retaliation under the ADA.",Positive,The court uses Kirkeberg to support the conclusion that a request for accom is a protected activity.
786455,Lentini v. California Center for the Arts,7410,Neff v. American Dairy Queen Corp.,"We agree with the Fifth Circuit’s guidelines for defining the scope of the verb “to operate” in this context. See Neff v. Am. Dairy Queen Corp., 58 F.3d 1063, 1066 (5th Cir.1995). Specifically, “to operate” means “to put or keep in operation,” “to control or direct the functioning of,” or “to conduct the affairs of; manage.” See id.; see also Coddington v. Adelphi Univ., 45 F.Supp.2d 211, 217 (E.D.N.Y.1999) (stating that the relevant standard is whether the individual “ha[d] the power to facilitate any necessary accommodation.”); Aikins v. St. Helena Hosp., 843 F.Supp. 1329, 1335 (N.D.Cal.1994) (stating that the operator requirement “retains accountability for those in a position to ensure nondiscrimination.’’ (emphasis added)). Employing these guidelines, we find that Vogel, who was the Director of Center Sales and Event Services, had the requisite authority to qualify as an “operator” under Title III. As the district court found, he “was in a position of authority, having the ability to instruct the Center staff on who could or could not be admitted to the theater.”",Positive,"This is a very clear positive--the Ninth Circuit states that it ""agree[s] with"" the Fifth Circuit on this."
2998138,Keane v. Sears Roebuck,118500,"US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett","Still, at the very least, the employer is obliged to provide an accommodation that effectively accommodates the disabled employee’s limitations. See US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 400 (2002) (“An ineffective ‘modification’ or ‘adjustment’ will not accommodate a disabled individual’s limitations.”) (emphasis in original).",Positive,Here the court is applying controlling precedent on this issue.
746251,Gilday v. Mecosta County,1621847,Coghlan v. HJ Heinz Co.,"The EEOC’s interpretive guidelines, however, state that “[t]he determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be made on a case by case basis, without regard to mitigating measures such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630 App. 1630.2(j). See also id. § 1630.2(h). The first question that we must address, then, is whether, in determining whether a person is disabled under the ADA, a court should look at the situation when the impairment is controlled by medication or treatment or, as the EEOC suggests, the court should evaluate the impairment without regard to the availability of such mitigating measures. The courts are divided on the question. Compare Doom v. City of Omaha, 115 F.3d 624, 627 (8th Cir.1997); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 520-21 (11th Cir.1996); Fallacaro v.

As the majority of these courts have held, the EEOC’s interpretation of the statute is the correct one.
...
[Second instance] First, the EEOC’s interpretation is consistent with the text of the statute. See, e.g., Harris, 102 F.3d at 521. But see Coghlan, 851 F.Supp. at 813 (claiming that the EEOC’s “gloss reads ‘limits’ right out of the statute because an insulin-dependent diabetic who takes insulin could perform major life activities and would therefore not be limited”).

746251,Gilday v. Mecosta County,1621847,Coghlan v. HJ Heinz Co.,"
[Third instance] The EEOC’s position on mitigating measures appears not in the regulations themselves, but in an appendix to the regulations labeled “Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630 App., Introduction. The appendix constitutes a set of interpretative, rather than legislative, rules and is, therefore, not binding law. See Coghlan v. H.J. Heinz Co., 851 F.Supp. 808, 811-12 (N.D.Tex.1994).

Monette v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1186 (6th Cir.1996). His employer then bears the burden of proving that a challenged job criterion is essential, and therefore a business necessity, or that the proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Id.

The district court found Saturn had reasonably accommodated Kiphart through his participation in the Member Placement Program. Indeed, Saturn admirably found temporary jobs for Kiphart for most of the 1300 days following his removal from his original team. 13 In previous cases cited by the district court, we have held employers have reasonably accommodated employees through far shorter job searches of only thirty-seven and forty days. See Monette, 90 F.3d at 1173; Smith v. Ameritech, 129 F.3d 857, 866 (6th Cir.1997). However, the issue before the Court today is not susceptible to mathematical solution. Rather, we must decide only whether Kiphart presented sufficient evidence to support the jury’s conclusion *587 Saturn failed to reasonably accommodate Kiphart. We believe he did.",Neutral,"The first citation simply supports the statement of law and the second one is illustrative, without the court clearly saying it was right or wrong (""not susceptible to mathematical solution"")"
174213,Kirkeberg v. Canadian Pacific Railway,791297,EEOC v. Sears,"Kirkeberg also claims that Canadian Pacific failed to make ""reasonable accommodations to [his] known physical ... limitations.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). The ADA, however, requires an employee to show that he is ""a qualified individual with a disability” in order to state a valid claim for failure to accommodate, id.; EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 417 F.3d 789, 797 (7th Cir.2005), so this claim fails as well.",Neutral,This is just cited to support a statement of the statutory law. It doesn't appear to endorse or criticize EEOC v. Sears.
174213,Kirkeberg v. Canadian Pacific Railway,797279,Gretillat v. Care Initiatives,"This final statement suggests that Kirkeberg’s right eye would acclimate to his vision loss, potentially rendering his “significant” discomfort temporary. To be substantially limiting, an impairment “must be of an extended or permanent duration,” Gretillat v. Care Initiatives, 481 F.3d 649, 652 (8th Cir. 2007), but Kirkeberg offered no medical evidence developed after February 2006 to address the degree to which his body acclimated and whether his difficulties were permanent. Nor did he present specific medical evidence concerning his “loss of depth perception and visual field.” Albertson’s, Inc., 527 U.S. at 567, 119 S.Ct. 2162.",Positive,"This cites a previous opinion from the same court (Eighth Circuit), which similarly considered the issue of duration as it relates to whether it is substantially limiting."
801002,"Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp., Inc.",777346,"Cotter v. Ajilon Services, Inc.","Consistent with Maddox, we used the “solely” standard in an ADA-only claim a year later, Monette v. Electronic Systems Corporation, 90 F.3d 1173, 1177-78 (6th Cir.1996), and before long that became the standard for relief under the ADA in this circuit, see, e.g., Macy v. Hopkins County Sch.

5288715,Perez-Sosa v. Garland,2678333,Barrett v. Salt Lake County,"The district court's view is not without some support in the case law. In Barrett v. Salt Lake County , the Tenth Circuit held that a prevailing Title VII plaintiff may not recover attorneys' fees for time spent in navigating the employer's optional grievance process even if such work was “useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to secure the final result obtained from the litigation.” 754 F.3d 864, 870 (10th Cir. 2014) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air (Delaware Valley ), 478 U.S. 546, 561, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986)). There, the court decided that the useful-and-necessary standard does not apply to actions under Title VII. See id. at 870-71; cf. Binta B. ex rel. S.A. v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 608, 631 (6th Cir. 2013) (“[W]e are troubled by the idea of ever permitting plaintiffs' counsel to receive fees for work performed in a completely separate case.”).

We do not agree. To determine “the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation,” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, an inquiring court must look not to labels but, rather, to the nature of the work and its utility to the case at hand, see Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 561, 106 S.Ct. 3088. That “look” is not constrained by the four corners of the particular case. See Nat'l Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec'y of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1335 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Instead, a court should award fees for all hours logged in connection with work that is “‘useful and of a type ordinarily necessary’ to secure the final result obtained from the litigation.” Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 561, 106 S.Ct. 3088 (quoting Webb v. Bd. of Educ., 471 U.S. 234, 243, 105 S.Ct. 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 233 (1985)); see Hutchinson ex rel. Julien v. Patrick, 636 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2011). This standard controls even when that work implicates some other case. See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de P.R., 187 F.3d 30, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (applying the “useful and of a type ordinarily necessary” standard to “work done in the [Puerto Rico] courts before the filing of the federal lawsuit”).",Negative,"Here, First Circuit explicitly disagrees with the Tenth Circuit on the idea that ""useful-and-necessary standard"" is inapplicable and that labels, rather than the nature of the work and its utility, are most important."
808793,Sanchez v. Vilsack,155762,Woodman v. Runyon,"Part of the government’s obligation is to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled employees. To prevail on a failure-to-accommodate claim a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is “otherwise qualified”; and (3) she requested a plausibly reasonable accommodation.
