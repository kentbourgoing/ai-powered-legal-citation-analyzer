2485868,Acevedo v. City of Philadelphia,2010-01-21T00:00:00.000000000+00:00,680 F. Supp. 2d 716 | 22 Am. Disabilities Cas. (BNA) 1769 | 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5232 | 2010 WL 271350,"In the case of Acevedo v. City of Philadelphia, the plaintiff, Robert Acevedo, brought a lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia alleging disability discrimination under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, facial invalidity, disparate impact, and violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involved the application of Philadelphia City's Civil Service Regulation 32, which provides benefits for disabled employees but has been criticized for its discriminatory effect on individuals with disabilities. The court held that a reasonable jury could differ on whether the County regarded patients as disabled, and it affirmed parts of the due process verdict but vacated the injunction. The court applied major statute law including Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.) and Substantive Due Process (Fourteenth Amendment). The plaintiff, a police officer, was injured on duty and was unable to carry a weapon or shoot with his right hand due to a stenar lesion in his right thumb. He was placed in a limited duty position within the Traffic Unit, where he was assigned to work under the Operations Room supervisor. Plaintiff satisfactorily performed his duties in the Traffic Division and received positive performance reviews. However, he was unable to recover from his injury to an extent that would allow him to resume all of the normal duties of the police officer classification in the Philadelphia Police Department. The defendant, the City of Philadelphia, argued that the plaintiff was not a qualified individual under the Rehabilitation Act because he could not perform the essential functions of a police officer with or without reasonable accommodations. The court found that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the essential functions of a police officer and whether the plaintiff could perform those functions with or without reasonable accommodations. The plaintiff also argued that Regulation 32 facially violates the Rehabilitation Act by denying public employees of their employment based on the genesis of their disability, without an interactive process, and without consideration of the individual nature of the disability, the individual's vocational profile, and whether or not they are otherwise qualified to continue their City employment.",161281,Frazier v. Simmons,2001-07-03T00:00:00.000000000+00:00,254 F.3d 1247 | 11 Am. Disabilities Cas. (BNA) 1690 | 2001 Colo. J. C.A.R. 3553 | 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 15087 | 2001 WL 748050,"The plaintiff, Steve E. Frazier, sued the defendant, Charles E. Simmons, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Kansas Department of Corrections, for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in his former employment as an investigator. The district court granted Simmons' motion for summary judgment on Frazier's Title I claims but denied his motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds. Both parties appealed, with Frazier arguing the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his Title I claims and in denying Simmons' motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment grounds. The Tenth Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of Simmons on Frazier's Title I claims, holding that Frazier was unable to perform the essential functions of an investigator job due to his disability, and that reasonable accommodations were not feasible. The court remanded the case to the district court for initial consideration of Frazier's Title II claims. Key arguments: - Frazier argued that he was disabled under the ADA, was a qualified individual, and was terminated because of his disability. He claimed the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his Title I claims by failing to analyze his multiple sclerosis under all three definitions of disability, leaving for the jury the factual inquiry into essential functions, and recognizing that Simmons could reasonably accommodate his disability by restructuring a marginal job duty, identifying vacant positions through the interactive process, and reassigning him to a vacancy. - Simmons argued that Frazier was not disabled because he was precluded from working only a narrow range of jobs and was not regarded as disabled. He claimed Frazier was unable to perform the essential functions of the jobs he desired, including Parole Officer I, Corrections Counselor I, and Corrections Manager II, due to his physical limitations. Court's conclusion: - The Tenth Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of Simmons on Frazier's Title I claims, holding that Frazier was unable to perform the essential functions of an investigator job due to his disability and that reasonable accommodations were not feasible.","Defendant cites to a series of federal cases wherein courts found that police officers and other public safety officials who are unable to perform certain physical job functions, such as physically restraining others or discharging a weapon, are not “qualified individuals” under the disabilities laws. (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 11-15.) All of these eases, however, made a determination, on the basis of the facts and evidence before the court at the time, that no genuine issue of fact existed as to the essential functions of the police officer positions in question. See, e.g., Frazier v. Simmons, 254 F.3d 1247, 1259-60 (10th Cir.2001) (finding that multiple physical requirements for police officer were essential functions where the written job description listed these multiple physical requirements and plaintiff had no probative contrary evidence)...On the other hand, Defendant fails to acknowledge the similar multitude of cases that have declined to make a factual determination of the essential functions of a police officer position where probative, contradictory evidence was presented to the court. ","Nothing in his testimony suggests an admission that he could not function as a police officer in another capacity, as he did in the Traffic Division.Nor does Defendant demonstrate that (a) Plaintiff understood that question regarding “regular functions” was referencing the legal term “essential functions” as defined in the Rehabilitation Act; or (b) Plaintiff had sufficient knowledge of what the official, established “essential functions” were for a Philadelphia police officer. 5 Second, Defendant cites to a series of federal cases wherein courts found that police officers and other public safety officials who are unable to perform certain physical job functions, such as physically restraining others or discharging a weapon, are not “qualified individuals” under the disabilities laws.

Oakland County Sheriffs Dept., 227 F.3d 719, 726-27 (6th Cir.2000) (finding that requirement of ability to restrain and search inmates was essential function of deputy sheriff position where written job description listed them and “potential for physical confrontation exist[ed] on a daily basis”; court noted that “inquiry into whether a function is essential is highly fact specific.”); Champ v.",Neutral,Neutral,"The court cited Frazier for illustrative purposes--as an example of a case cited by the defense that reached a conclusion where there was no genuine issue of fact regarding the essential functions of the job position in question. Frazier's factual scenario is different from the one presented in Acevedo, however, so it is not applicable. This is neither a positive nor negative treatment.","The citing case (Acevedo v. City of Philadelphia) mentions Frazier v. Simmons as part of a list of cases cited by the defendant to support their argument about essential functions of police officers. The court in Acevedo distinguishes these cases, including Frazier, from the present case. Specifically, the court notes: 'All of these cases, however, made a determination, on the basis of the facts and evidence before the court at the time, that no genuine issue of fact existed as to the essential functions of the police officer positions in question.' This quote indicates that the court is not using Frazier as supportive authority, but rather as an example of a different factual scenario. The neutral citation serves to illustrate a contrast with the current case, where the court finds that a genuine issue of material fact does exist regarding the essential functions of a police officer.",https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2485868/acevedo-v-city-of-philadelphia/

He requested priority placement within the Department of Justice but was denied due to the risk of infecting others with his blood in violent confrontations. Fedro sued under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, alleging handicap discrimination. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and Fedro appealed. The defendant argued that the Marshals Service did not discriminate against Fedro as it had followed its existing staffing policies and procedures. The plaintiff contended that the Marshals Service failed to make reasonable accommodations for his disability by not offering him a full-time position or restructuring existing positions. The court held that the Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to create a new position for an employee who is no longer capable of performing the essential functions of their old job. The court also found that the Marshers Service did not discriminate against Fedro and followed the proper procedures for priority placement.

Luckiewicz, 670 F.Supp.2d at 408-09. Under the Act, an employer need not create positions specifically for the handicapped employee. Shiring, 90 F.3d at 831 (citing Fedro v. Reno, 21 F.3d 1391, 1395 (7th Cir.1994)). Thus, the fact that Plaintiff worked at a light duty position for two years in which he was not required to carry a firearm does not bear oh whether or not the carrying of a firearm is an “essential function” of a police officer position. 4 Nor must the Court consider an otherwise non-existent position as an accommodation that would make Plaintiff qualified.","Second, Plaintiff argues that the Philadelphia Police Department contains literally hundreds of positions that do not entail regular patrol duties, thereby making it a falsity for the Police Department to singularly classify *734 the “police officer” position without individualized job functions set out for the different jobs within the Department.Finally, Plaintiff contends that the fact that the City continued to employ him as a police officer for two years after he was injured and unable to obtain a weapons certification from the state demonstrates that such a certification is not an “essential function of the job.” As to Plaintiffs third point — 'that he worked successfully in a limited duty position for two years — courts have held that the mere fact that a plaintiff is able to perform the responsibilities of a limited duty position, even over an extended period, does not make that plaintiff a “qualified individual” under the Rehabilitation Act.

Plaintiffs first two proffers of evidence, however, give this Court greater pause.

The court then applies the two cited decisions (including Fedro) to support its conclusion (indicated partly by the use of the term ""Thus,"") that the fact that the employee worked for two years in a light duty position had no bearing on whether carrying a firearm was an ""essential function"" of a police officer position.","The citing case uses Fedro v. Reno to support a legal principle regarding employer obligations under the Rehabilitation Act.

This citation directly supports the court's reasoning that the plaintiff's ability to perform in a limited duty position does not make him a 'qualified individual' under the Act.

City of Erie, Pennsylvania, Marinelli argued that his residual pain from a truck accident constituted a physical impairment that substantially limited his major life activities, making him disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The City contended that Marinelli failed to present sufficient evidence of an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. The court held that Marinelli's impairment, while affecting his ability to perform certain tasks, did not substantially limit him in the major life activity of working. The court noted that Marinelli's injury only prevented him from driving the specific type of snow plow used by the City, but he could still perform most other shift crew work. The court also pointed out that Marinelli had obtained a commercial driver's license after the accident, further indicating that his impairment did not substantially limit him in the major life activity of working.

Thompson claimed that his back and arm injuries substantially limited him in the major life activity of working, and that Dot Foods failed to provide reasonable accommodations by denying him the vacant dispatcher position. Dot Foods contended that Thompson was not disabled as defined by the ADA, and that it did not discriminate against him or deny him a reasonable accommodation. The court found that Thompson was significantly restricted in performing a class or broad range of jobs due to his work restrictions, which prevented him from performing the essential functions of an over-the-road truck driver for any employer. However, the court also determined that Thompson was not a qualified individual with a disability as he could not perform the essential functions of his previous position with or without reasonable accommodations.

Bell and Tania Morales, brought a class action lawsuit against the City of New York and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, alleging inadequate emergency preparedness plans for people with disabilities in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL). The City opposed the motion for class certification, primarily arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing due to insufficient injury in fact. The court held that both the individual and organizational plaintiffs had standing. The individual plaintiffs, Bell and Morales, had standing based on their own disabilities and the threat of future harm. The organizational plaintiffs, BCID and CIDNY, had standing as representatives of their members and due to their own injuries resulting from the City's failure to address the unique needs of people with disabilities in its emergency planning. The court granted the motion for class certification, finding that the requirements of Rule 23(a) were met. The class was defined as ""all people with disabilities, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, who are within the City of New York and the jurisdiction served by the City of New York’s emergency preparedness programs and services.""

The court granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3), finding that common questions of law and fact predominated over individual issues and that a class action was superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The class consisted of all New York citizens and residents who purchased a new 12-month term of Costco membership subsequent to the expiration of their prior annual memberships and had their new membership terms backdated by Costco. The court also approved Meiselman, Denlea, Packman, Carton & Eberz P.C. as class counsel. Despite arguments from Costco that certain business members lacked standing under Section 349 and that putative class members who were able to shop despite their expired status could not prevail under the statute, the court found that these issues did not preclude class certification.

Fresenius Medical Care North America, Elizabeth Rask, a patient care technician at Fresenius's kidney dialysis clinics in Minnesota, sued her employer for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA), and Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) after her termination. Rask argued that her depression was a disability, and her absences were covered medical leave under the FMLA. To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA and MHRA, Rask needed to prove that she was disabled, qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, and suffered an adverse employment action due to her disability. However, the court held that Rask failed to show that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job because of her unpredictable absences and lack of proper notice to her employer. Regarding the FMLA claim, Rask argued that Fresenius violated the act by terminating her employment based on absences for which she should have been given FMLA leave. The court found that Rask failed to provide Fresenius with sufficient notice that she was taking FMLA leave, and the statute does not specify what kind of notice employees are required to give when the need for leave is unforeseeable. However, the employer's duties are triggered when the employee provides enough information to put the employer on notice that they may be in need of FMLA leave. The court concluded that Rask did not put Fresenius on notice that she had a serious health condition, as required for FMLA leave. Major statute law applied: Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § § 12101-12213), Minnesota Human Rights Act (Minn.Stat. §§ 363A.01-363A.41), and Family and Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2654).","Brown must show that he gave KCF adequate notice that he was seeking FMLA leave during the disputed time period.

In the case of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., the EEOC brought a claim against Abercrombie for failing to accommodate Samantha Elauf's religious practice of wearing a hijab in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Abercrombie argued that it was not on notice of the need for an accommodation and that Elauf failed to inform the company of her religious belief and the need for an accommodation before its hiring decision. The Tenth Circuit held that Abercrombie was entitled to summary judgment because there was no genuine dispute of material fact that Elauf never informed Abercrombie prior to its hiring decision that her practice of wearing a hijab was based on her religious beliefs and that she needed an accommodation for it, due to a conflict between it and Abercrombie’s clothing policy. The court reasoned that Elauf's failure to provide explicit notice to Abercrombie of her need for an accommodation was a fundamental requirement under Title VII, and that the EEOC's arguments to the contrary were unpersuasive. Major statute law applied: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17.

The second part of the opinion text is summarized as follows:
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) argued that Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. (Abercrombie) violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by failing to accommodate Samantha Elauf's religious practice of wearing a hijab. The EEOC contended that Abercrombie was aware of Elauf's religious beliefs and the potential conflict with its Look Policy but did not engage in the required interactive process to explore possible accommodations. Abercrombie argued that it was Elauf's responsibility to inform the company of the conflict and request an accommodation. The court held that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether Abercrombie failed to accommodate Elauf's religious practice. The court found that Abercrombie had knowledge of Elauf's religious beliefs and the potential conflict with its Look Policy but did not initiate a dialogue with Elauf to determine if an accommodation was possible. The court also noted that Abercrombie's evidence contradicted the EEOC's prima facie evidence, creating a factual dispute as to whether Abercrombie could have reasonably accommodated Elauf's religious practice without undue hardship. Major statute law applied: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.).",109692,"Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.

(BNA) 1697,"The case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison (1977) involved a dispute between Trans World Airlines (TWA) and its employee, Larry G. Hardison, over Hardison's request for religious accommodations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Hardison, a Sabbath observer, sought to be exempted from working on Saturdays due to his religious beliefs. TWA argued that it had made reasonable efforts to accommodate Hardison by allowing him to transfer to a different shift and offering him a four-day workweek. However, the Court of Appeals held that TWA had not made reasonable accommodations and that it was required to do so without undue hardship. The key arguments of the parties were as follows: TWA argued that it had made reasonable efforts to accommodate Hardison's religious needs by allowing him to transfer to a different shift and offering him a four-day workweek. TWA also contended that requiring it to make further accommodations would create an establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment. Hardison argued that TWA had failed to make reasonable accommodations by not allowing him to work a four-day workweek or transferring him to a different department without violating the seniority system. He also argued that TWA's seniority system itself constituted an unlawful employment practice under Title VII. The court's conclusion was that TWA had not violated Title VII by failing to accommodate Hardison's religious needs. The court held that TWA had made reasonable efforts to accommodate Hardison and that further accommodations would have caused undue hardship. The court also rejected Hardison's argument that the seniority system itself was an unlawful employment practice. Major statute law being applied included Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically Section 703(a)(1) and Section 701(j). Section 703(a)(1) makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee or prospective employee on the basis of religion. Section 701(j) defines religion and requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for the religious observances of their employees, unless it would cause undue hardship.","Title VII’s implementing regulations “impose[ ] an obligation on the employer ‘to reasonably accommodate the religious practices of an employee or prospective employee, unless the employer demonstrates that accommodation would result in undue hardship on the conduct of its business.’” Thomas, 225 F.3d at 1155 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2(b)(1), (2)); accord 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2(b)(1); see Trans World Airlines v.

The School District contends that Hastings cannot establish that she was disabled as defined at the time of her termination and lacks sufficient evidence to prove age discrimination. The court found that genuine issues of material fact exist in this case, as Hastings presented evidence of her past cancer diagnoses, accommodations received during treatment, and the inconsistent application of leave policies. Additionally, there is a dispute regarding whether Hastings was regarded as having a disabling impairment under the ADA.

Wisbey, appeals the district court's dismissal of her lawsuit alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) by the City of Lincoln, Nebraska. Wisbey worked as an emergency dispatcher for the City until her termination in 2007 due to concerns about her ability to perform her job effectively due to depression and anxiety. Wisbey argues that the City regarded her as disabled under the ADA, that she could perform the essential functions of her job, and that the City failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. The City, on the other hand, argues that Wisbey failed to establish a factual dispute regarding any essential element of her case. Under the ADA, Wisbey must demonstrate that she was a disabled person, qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, and suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Wisbey concedes that she does not have a disability but argues that she was regarded as having an impairment that substantially limits her ability to work. However, the record shows that Wisbey was terminated based on Dr. Chesen's determination that she was unfit for duty and not based on any myths or stereotypes about being disabled. As for the FMLA claim, Wisbey argues that the City's request for a fitness-for-duty exam was unwarranted because the City had previously accepted her doctor's certification that she could perform the essential functions of her job with intermittent leave. However, the FMLA does not provide leave for leave's sake but instead provides leave with an expectation that the employee will return to work after the leave ends. Wisbey's request for intermittent leave for an indefinite period implies that she is not qualified for a position where reliable attendance is a bona fide requirement. Major statute law applied: Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101-12213) and Family Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. § 2601-2654).","To show that one is disabled under federal law, an individual must show that she: (1) has a physical, sensory, or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). Under the “regarded as” prong, a person may be disabled under the ADA if, notwithstanding the absence of an actual disability, he is perceived or “regarded as” having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Weber v. Strippit, Inc., 186 F.3d 907, 914 (8th Cir.1999). Under the ADA, “the ‘regarded as’ provision was established to combat ‘archaic attitudes, erroneous perceptions, and myths’ working to the disadvantage of the disabled or perceived disabled.” Wisbey v. City of Lincoln, 612 F.3d 667, 672-73 (8th Cir.2010) (quoting Brunko v. Mercy Hosp., 260 F.3d 939, 942 (8th Cir.2001)).
Working has been recognized as a major life activity. See Breitkreutz v. Cambrex Charles City, Inc., 450 F.3d 780, 784 (8th Cir.2006); Nuzum v. Ozark Auto. Distrib., 432 F.3d 839, 844 (8th Cir.2005); Webner v. Titan Distrib., Inc., 267 F.3d 828, 834-35 (8th Cir.2001); Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Amer., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 949 (8th Cir.1999). “ ‘In order to be regarded as disabled with respect to the major life activity of working, the employer must mistakenly believe that [an] actual impairment substantially limits the employee’s ability to work.’ ” Wisbey, 612 F.3d at 672 (quoting Chalfant v. Titan Distribution, Inc., 475 F.3d 982, 989 (8th Cir.2007)). A substantial limitation on the major life activity of working means that an individual must be “significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i). The test is whether the defendant treated an employee adversely because it regarded the employee as having an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Weber, 186 F.3d at 915; Kellogg, 233 F.3d at 1089.
Under the law in effect at the time of the plaintiffs termination, the terms “major life activities” and “substantial limita *964 tion” were interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled. 3 Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002) (abrogated by statute in Pub. L. 110-325 (2008)); accord Ristrom v. Asbestos Workers Local Sk Joint Apprentice Comm., 370 F.3d 763, 768 (8th Cir.2004). Courts were to consider the nature, severity, duration, and long-term impact of the impairment when deciding whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Wood v. Crown Redi-Mix, Inc., 339 F.3d 682, 685 (2003). The impairment also had to be of an extended or permanent duration. Williams, 534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681.","To show that one is disabled under federal law, an individual must show that she: (1) has a physical, sensory, or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (1)(A)-(C).

Independent School District No. 11, Sally Nyrop, an employee with multiple sclerosis, sued her employer for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA), alleging the School District failed to reasonably accommodate her disability, refused to hire her for an administrative position, and retaliated against her for filing a charge of discrimination. The district court granted summary judgment to the School District, finding Nyrop failed to prove her physical impairment substantially limited a major life activity, had no record of disability, and there was no evidence of retaliation. Nyrop argued on appeal that her MS substantially limits major life activities, she has a record of such impairment, and there is a question of fact whether the School District regarded her as disabled. To be considered disabled under the ADA, Nyrop needed to demonstrate she had a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. The court found Nyrop's symptoms, such as difficulty speaking clearly, projecting her voice, and sensitivity to heat, did not substantially limit major life activities as she could still work and perform daily activities. Nyrop also claimed she had a record of disability due to her history of physical impairments and the School District's awareness and accommodations.

Norand Corporation, Berg, a non-insulin dependent diabetic, brought employment discrimination claims against Norand under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA), alleging discrimination based on her disability and sex. Norand moved for summary judgment, which was granted by the district court. Berg appealed. Berg argued that her diabetes substantially limits her major life activity of working by limiting her to a 40- to 50-hour work week, causing continuous joint pain, making it difficult for her to focus on her job due to pain, and making it difficult for her to speak. However, she admitted that she could effectively perform her duties at Norand if her workload was reduced to 40 to 50 hours per week. The court found that Berg had not shown any class of jobs or broad range of jobs from different classes from which she is excluded because of her diabetes, and thus, she was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working. Berg also argued that Norand paid male employees higher wages than it paid her for jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and that this constituted wage discrimination under the Equal Pay Act. However, Berg only provided conclusory affidavit testimony that the male managers to whom she compared herself had jobs ""equal"" to hers, and she did not articulate how they were similar in experience, education, or training. The court found that Berg had failed to establish a prima facie case under the Equal Pay Act. The court also dismissed Berg's state law claims of negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied contract, and false imprisonment. Berg argued that Norand had impliedly promised her job security and that her termination was a breach of that promise. However, the court found that Berg's employment agreement explicitly stated that her employment was at-will, and that Iowa law disfavors implied contracts that conflict with written agreements. Berg also argued that Norand falsely represented to her that she would not be terminated based on her disability, but the court found that Berg was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA or the ICRA, and thus, her termination did not contravene public policy or Norand's own internal policy.","No separate summary judgment standard exists for discrimination or retaliation cases and such cases are not immune from summary judgment.

The School District contends that Hastings cannot establish that she was disabled as defined at the time of her termination and lacks sufficient evidence to prove age discrimination.

New York Life, Inc., the plaintiff, Sheryl Henderson, brought a lawsuit against her employer, New York Life, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state law claims for negligent training, negligent supervision, negligent retention, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case involved Henderson's claims of disability discrimination and her requests for accommodations due to her immune deficiency disorder (CVIDD) and asthma. The key arguments of the parties were as follows: Plaintiff's Arguments: - Henderson argued that she is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, as her CVIDD and asthma substantially limit her major life activities of working and breathing. - She claimed that New York Life failed to provide reasonable accommodations, such as moving her workstation away from air vents and allowing her to work from home. - Henderson also argued that New York Life retaliated against her for filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Defendant's Arguments: - New York Life argued that Henderson did not meet the definition of a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA because her impairments did not substantially limit her major life activities. - They contended that Henderson failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by not filing a timely charge with the EEOC and that her state law claims were not related to her ADA claims. - New York Life also argued that they provided reasonable accommodations to Henderson, such as moving her workstation away from air vents and allowing her to take medical leave. The court held that: - Henderson failed to establish that she is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA because her impairments did not substantially limit her major life activities. - Henderson failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by not filing a timely charge with the EEOC for her state law claims. - New York Life did not violate the ADA by denying Henderson's request to work from home because it would have imposed an undue hardship on the company.

Industrial Coils, Inc., the plaintiff, Eleanor Schluter, brought a civil action against her employer, alleging discrimination based on her insulin-dependent diabetes under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The key arguments of the parties were as follows: Plaintiff argued that she was entitled to summary judgment because she was disabled as a matter of law, defendant could not carry its burden of showing that the vision test used to exclude her from her position was job-related and consistent with business necessity, and defendant failed to accommodate her disability. Defendant argued that plaintiff could not meet her burden of proving she was disabled under the ADA, she could perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation, and she was not discriminated against because of a disability. The court held that defendant was entitled to summary judgment because plaintiff had failed to adduce facts sufficient to carry her threshold burden of showing that she was disabled and entitled to the protections of the ADA. The court found that plaintiff's diabetes did not substantially limit her major life activities, as she had controlled her condition with insulin and had never suffered a severe insulin reaction at work. The court also rejected plaintiff's argument that she was ""regarded as disabled"" because defendant perceived her vision impairment as limiting her in the major life activity of working, as plaintiff had not shown that defendant regarded her as having an impairment that would limit her employment opportunities generally. Major statute law applied in this case included Title I of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)), which prohibits covered entities from discriminating in employment related decisions against qualified persons with disabilities, and the definition of disability under the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)), which includes a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.","To survive NYL’s summary judgment motion, Henderson must meet the threshold burden of establishing that she is disabled under the statute.

The plaintiff, who is African-American, was employed by Dow from 1987 to 2003 and was represented by the United Steelworkers of America. In February 2001, he was diagnosed with keratoconus, an eye condition that made him sensitive to dust and chemical vapors. Despite efforts to accommodate his disability, Dow terminated his employment in May 2003. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to warrant a trial on the question of whether his termination was a result of illegal discrimination under federal or state law. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that he was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and PWDCRA, and that Dow failed to provide reasonable accommodations for his disability. He also claimed that Dow's actions were motivated by race. The court found that the plaintiff had not established a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA or PWDCRA. While the plaintiff's eye condition was a physical impairment, the court held that it did not substantially limit a major life activity to a considerable or large degree. The plaintiff admitted that he was able to perform most tasks that required sight and could drive, read, prepare meals, and do household chores. The court also found that the plaintiff had not shown that he was a qualified person with a disability or that Dow violated its duty to allow a reasonable accommodation. Regarding the plaintiff's race discrimination claims, the court found that there was no direct evidence of discrimination and that the plaintiff had not established a circumstantial case.

Saturn Corporation, Kiphart, an employee with various hand, arm, and neck impairments, sued Saturn and its unions under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) after being removed from his work team and placed on involuntary medical leave for seven months. The case touched on Saturn's labor-management partnership and team-based manufacturing process. Kiphart argued Saturn misused its job rotation system to justify refusing to place him on any team assigned one or more tasks he could not perform. Saturn argued it fully implemented and enforced the job rotation system, which was a building block of its operation. The jury found in favor of Kiphart, but the district court ordered the verdict not be entered and later granted Saturn's motion for judgment as a matter of law. Kiphart appealed. The court held that Kiphart presented sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. The job rotation system was not an essential function of the jobs at Saturn, as some job descriptions did not require full rotation, and teams did not fully rotate tasks. Saturn's policy of placing restricted employees on involuntary medical leave regardless of their ability to continue to perform in temporary positions was also unreasonable. The district court improperly ordered the jury verdict not be entered and failed to provide an explanation for its decision or delay in acting on Saturn's motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Pulaski County, Arkansas, Scruggs appealed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Pulaski County on her claims of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), and retaliation under the ADA, Section 504, the Arkansas Civil Rights Act (ACRA), and the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Scruggs, a juvenile detention officer, claimed the county discriminated against her due to her inability to lift 40 pounds, a requirement for the position, and her need for reasonable accommodations. The county argued that the ability to lift 40 pounds was an essential function of the job and that no reasonable accommodation was available. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and Section 504, Scruggs needed to show she was a qualified individual with a disability, was able to perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation, and suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. The court found that Scruggs was not a qualified individual because she could not perform the essential function of lifting 40 pounds. Scruggs proposed accommodations, such as an additional week of unpaid leave or a shift change, were not reasonable. Scruggs also claimed retaliation under the ADA, Section 504, the ACRA, and the FMLA. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, she needed to show she engaged in a protected activity, the employer took an adverse action against her, and there was a causal connection between the adverse action and the protected activity. The court found that Scruggs' request for additional time to obtain a revised FMLA certification was not a reasonable accommodation and, therefore, not protected activity. The court concluded that Scruggs had not established a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation under the ADA, Section 504, the ACRA, or the FMLA. The major statute laws applied were the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.",174213,Kirkeberg v. Canadian Pacific Railway,2010-08-27T00:00:00.000000000+00:00,619 F.3d 898 | 23 Am.

Canadian Pacific Railway, Mike Kirkeberg brought claims against Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) for disability discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA), as well as violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and the Minnesota Whistleblower Act. Kirkeberg, who worked as the Administrator of Employee Assistance Programs for CPR, became legally blind in one eye due to a central retinal vein occlusion and later disclosed his hepatitis C diagnosis to his supervisor. He requested accommodations, including working from home, but was denied. After a break-in at CPR, Kirkeberg's computer was stolen, and he believed it would not have been stolen if he had been allowed to work from home. CPR eventually outsourced the EAP, and Kirkeberg was terminated. Kirkeberg argued that his monocular vision and hepatitis C substantially limited his major life activities, including seeing, walking, reading, concentrating, thinking, driving, and working. However, the court found that Kirkeberg failed to present sufficient evidence to show that his conditions substantially limited these major life activities. The court also rejected Kirkeberg's argument that he was regarded as disabled under the ADA and MHRA, as there was no evidence that CPR regarded him as having an impairment that substantially limited his ability to work. Regarding Kirkeberg's retaliation claim under the ADA, the court held that an employee who requests a reasonable accommodation in good faith is protected from retaliation. However, the court found that Kirkeberg's statement to his supervisor that the computer would not have been stolen if he had been allowed to work from home did not constitute a request for reasonable accommodation. Major statute law applied: Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213), Minnesota Human Rights Act (Minn. Stat. §§ 363A.01-.41), Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634).","Scruggs characterizes the request for additional time to obtain a revised FMLA certification from Dr. Chi as an ADA accommodation and thus a statutorily protected activity.

Scruggs asserts the timing of her termination shows a causal connection between her protected activity and the county’s adverse employment action.

(CCH) 11 | 2004 WL 1171695,"In Kathleen Lentini v. California Center for the Arts, Escondido, Alan Corbin, and Randy Vogel, the plaintiff, a quadriplegic woman with a service dog named Jazz, sued the defendants for violating her rights under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California's Unruh and Disabled Persons Acts. The defendants, who operated a not-for-profit arts center, had a written policy allowing certified assistance animals but an unwritten policy of admitting only ""recognizable"" service animals without questioning. Lentini and Jazz were initially denied entry due to Jazz's barking during intermissions at two performances. After a bench trial, the district court found that the defendants had violated the ADA and awarded damages under the Unruh Act. The defendants argued that the ordered modification of their policies, which required them to admit service animals that had made noise on previous occasions if the noise was made for a legitimate reason or if the behavior would otherwise be acceptable to the Center, was unnecessary and unreasonable. They contended that the modification would fundamentally alter the nature of their services and facilities. However, the court found that the modification was both reasonable and necessary, as it struck a balance between the Center's concerns and Lentini's needs. The court also found that the Center's prior policies already accommodated individuals with disabilities and that the modifications were necessary for Lentini because she could not separate from Jazz during a concert. The defendants also challenged the damages awarded under the Unruh Act, arguing that a showing of intentional discrimination was required. However, the court held that the 1992 amendment to the Unruh Act, which provided that a violation of the ADA is a violation of the Unruh Act, did not require a showing of intentional discrimination. The court affirmed the damages award, which totaled $7,000 for Lentini's deterrence from attending seven performances and individual awards of $5,000 to Corbin and $1,000 to Vogel.

American Dairy Queen Corp., Margo Neff, a disabled individual, sued American Dairy Queen Corporation (ADQ) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for failing to make two of its San Antonio stores accessible to her. Neff argued that ADQ ""operates"" the stores and is therefore responsible for removing architectural barriers under section 302 of the ADA. ADQ contended that it does not ""operate"" the stores as it only licenses the use of its trademarks and operates without day-to-day control over the stores. The court held that the dispute between the parties is a question of law, and the Nacogdoches Store franchise agreement, which Neff relied on to establish ADQ's control, is unambiguous. The court further held that the control provided for in the agreement is not sufficient to bring ADQ within the scope of section 302. The court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment to ADQ.

As the district court found, he “was in a position of authority, having the ability to instruct the Center staff on who could or could not be admitted to the theater.”","Vogel’s Individual Liability The district court found Vogel individually liable to Lentini in the amount of $1,000 “based on his individual liability under the ADA as incorporated by the Unruh Act.” The appellants contend that this holding was erroneous. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination “by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182 (a) (emphasis added); see also PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. at 676-77, 121 S.Ct. 1879. The district court found both Corbin and Vogel liable under the ADA as “operators” of a place of public accommodation.

Keane, who worked as a sales associate at Sears, experienced neuropathy and numbness in her right leg, which made it difficult for her to walk long distances. She requested accommodations, such as using a shortcut through the shoe stockroom or parking near her work area, but was denied. The EEOC and Keane argued that Sears failed to reasonably accommodate her disability by denying her requests for accommodations and creating a hostile work environment. Sears argued that it was unaware of Keane's disability and that the accommodations she requested would have imposed an undue hardship. The court held that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Keane was disabled under the ADA, whether Sears was aware of her disability, and whether the breakdown in the interactive process was caused by Sears. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.

Barnett, 535 U.S. 391 (2002), involved a dispute over the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in relation to seniority systems. The plaintiff, Robert Barnett, a disabled employee, sought reassignment to a mailroom position as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, despite the rules of US Airways' seniority system that granted other employees the right to bid for the job. The court held that the seniority system would generally prevail in the run of cases, as the accommodation demand would not be reasonable in the absence of special circumstances. The key arguments of the parties were as follows: The plaintiff, Barnett, argued that the ADA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, even if it means violating seniority rules. He contended that the seniority system should only be a factor in the undue hardship analysis, and that a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine whether any particular reassignment would constitute an undue hardship. The defendant, US Airways, argued that the seniority system is a significant factor in the undue hardship analysis and that any significant alteration of the system would result in undue hardship to both the company and its non-disabled employees. They claimed that the seniority system is a bona fide and established policy that employees have relied upon for decades, and that any departure from it would undermine employee expectations of consistent, uniform treatment. The court concluded that the seniority system would generally prevail in the run of cases, and that the plaintiff must present special circumstances to show that an exception from the seniority policy can constitute a reasonable accommodation in the particular case. Major statute law applied: 1. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) - 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. 2. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. 3. Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 - 29 U.S.C.","Still, at the very least, the employer is obliged to provide an accommodation that effectively accommodates the disabled employee’s limitations. See US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 400 (2002) (“An ineffective ‘modification’ or ‘adjustment’ will not accommodate a disabled individual’s limitations.”) (emphasis in original).","Rather, it argues, and the district court held, that Sears provided Keane with reasonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodations under the ADA include “making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.” Nos. 04-2222 & 04-2493 21 § 12111(9). “It is the employer’s prerogative to choose a reasonable accommodation; an employer is not required to provide the particular accommodation that an employee requests.” Jay v. Intermet Wagner, Inc., 233 F.3d 1014, 1017 (7th Cir. 2000). Still, at the very least, the employer is obliged to provide an accommodation that effectively accommodates the disabled employee’s limitations. See US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 400 (2002) (“An ineffective ‘modification’ or ‘adjustment’ will not accommodate a disabled individual’s limitations.”) (emphasis in original).The parties agree that Keane was able to perform all of the aspects of her job but simply had trouble getting to and from her workstation within the store. If Sears was effective in making its facility “readily accessible to and usable by” Keane, then it is not liable. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(A); see also Vande Zande v. State of Wisc. Dep’t of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 546 (7th Cir. 1995) (“The duty of reasonable accommodation is satisfied when the employer does what is necessary to enable the disabled worker to work in reasonable comfort.”).",Positive,Positive,Here the court is applying controlling precedent on this issue.,"The citing case (Keane v. Sears Roebuck) uses US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett to support the legal standard for reasonable accommodations under the ADA. The court directly quotes Barnett, stating: 'An ineffective 'modification' or 'adjustment' will not accommodate a disabled individual's limitations.' This quote is used to emphasize that employers must provide effective accommodations. The citing case applies this principle to evaluate whether Sears' accommodations for Keane were effective in making the facility accessible and usable, demonstrating a positive treatment of the cited case as authoritative on ADA accommodation standards.",https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2998138/keane-judith-v-sears-roebuck/

Mecosta County, the plaintiff, a former emergency medical technician for Mecosta County, argued that his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus constituted a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and that his employer failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation by transferring him to a less chaotic station. The defendants, Mecosta County and the Firefighters Association of Michigan, contended that Gilday's diabetes did not substantially limit a major life activity and that he was not qualified to perform the essential functions of his job due to his rude behavior towards patients and colleagues. The court held that Gilday presented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether his diabetes constituted a disability under the ADA. The court found that Gilday's testimony regarding the symptoms he experienced before controlling his diabetes and the impact of stress on his blood sugar levels provided evidence that his diabetes substantially limited a major life activity, which is the ability to work. The court also held that Gilday had presented evidence that he was qualified for the position with reasonable accommodations, such as a transfer to a less chaotic station. Major statute law applied: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) and Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.).",1621847,Coghlan v.

Coghlan brought an employment discrimination claim against defendants H.J. Heinz Company and Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., alleging violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) based on his insulin-dependent diabetes. Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Coghlan did not have a disability as defined by the ADA. The court denied the motion, finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether Coghlan's diabetes substantially limits a major life activity. The ADA, a comprehensive federal legislation, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in various aspects of employment. The term ""disability"" under the ADA includes a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. Defendant Ore-Ida initially argued that Coghlan did not have a disability as the Act contemplates, as his diabetes did not substantially limit a major life activity. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued regulations interpreting Title I of the ADA, stating that a diabetic who without insulin would lapse into a coma is substantially limited because they cannot perform major life activities without the aid of medication. The EEOC's interpretative guidance is not binding but may provide insight into congressional intent. Coghlan countered by claiming that the EEOC interpretative gloss rests on legislative history and the Supreme Court case Arline v. School Board of Nassau County, which dealt with a person afflicted with tuberculosis and the definition of ""handicapped individual"" under the Rehabilitation Act. The Court found that Arline was not directly applicable to the issue at hand, as it dealt primarily with the record-of-impairment prong rather than the substantially-limits portion of the test and the HHS language considered in Arline was not comparable to the EEOC's guidelines.","The EEOC’s interpretive guidelines, however, state that “[t]he determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be made on a case by case basis, without regard to mitigating measures such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630 App. 1630.2(j). See also id. § 1630.2(h). The first question that we must address, then, is whether, in determining whether a person is disabled under the ADA, a court should look at the situation when the impairment is controlled by medication or treatment or, as the EEOC suggests, the court should evaluate the impairment without regard to the availability of such mitigating measures. The courts are divided on the question. Compare Doom v. City of Omaha, 115 F.3d 624, 627 (8th Cir.1997); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 520-21 (11th Cir.1996); Fallacaro v.

The appendix constitutes a set of interpretative, rather than legislative, rules and is, therefore, not binding law. See Coghlan v. H.J.

The court held that Gilday presented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether his diabetes constituted a disability under the ADA. The court found that Gilday's testimony regarding the symptoms he experienced before controlling his diabetes and the impact of stress on his blood sugar levels provided evidence that his diabetes substantially limited a major life activity, which is the ability to work. The court also held that Gilday had presented evidence that he was qualified for the position with reasonable accommodations, such as a transfer to a less chaotic station.

Coghlan brought an employment discrimination claim against defendants H.J. Heinz Company and Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., alleging violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) based on his insulin-dependent diabetes. Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Coghlan did not have a disability as defined by the ADA. The court denied the motion, finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether Coghlan's diabetes substantially limits a major life activity. The ADA, a comprehensive federal legislation, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in various aspects of employment. The term ""disability"" under the ADA includes a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. Defendant Ore-Ida initially argued that Coghlan did not have a disability as the Act contemplates, as his diabetes did not substantially limit a major life activity. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued regulations interpreting Title I of the ADA, stating that a diabetic who without insulin would lapse into a coma is substantially limited because they cannot perform major life activities without the aid of medication. The EEOC's interpretative guidance is not binding but may provide insight into congressional intent. Coghlan countered by claiming that the EEOC interpretative gloss rests on legislative history and the Supreme Court case Arline v. School Board of Nassau County, which dealt with a person afflicted with tuberculosis and the definition of ""handicapped individual"" under the Rehabilitation Act. The Court found that Arline was not directly applicable to the issue at hand, as it dealt primarily with the record-of-impairment prong rather than the substantially-limits portion of the test and the HHS language considered in Arline was not comparable to the EEOC's guidelines.","
[Third instance] The EEOC’s position on mitigating measures appears not in the regulations themselves, but in an appendix to the regulations labeled “Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630 App., Introduction.

Saturn Corp., the plaintiff, Ronald Jeffrey Kiphart, brought an ADA claim against Saturn Corporation and two unions, alleging discrimination based on his disabilities. The case involved a single pilot plaintiff, and the only remaining claim against Saturn was the ADA claim for failure to reasonably accommodate his alleged disabilities. At the close of all the evidence, Saturn moved for judgment as a matter of law. Mr. Kiphart, a 46-year-old employee of General Motors since 1971, began working for Saturn in 1990. He claimed to have had tendinitis, bilateral chronic ulnar neuropathy, a fused cervical spine at the C6-C7 level, and chronic depression during the relevant period, which substantially limited his ability to perform manual tasks, lift more than thirty pounds, and sleep and work effectively. He argued that Saturn failed to accommodate his disabilities by not permanently placing him on a team where he could be fully functional and fully rotational. Saturn contended that Mr. Kiphart was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA, either because his physical and mental impairments did not substantially limit one or more major life activities or because he was not an otherwise qualified person with a disability. Saturn argued that an essential function of Mr. Kiphart's position was that he be fully functional and fully rotational, and since he was not, he was not an otherwise qualified person with a disability. Saturn also claimed that it provided Mr. Kiphart with a reasonable accommodation by placing him in the Member Placement Program (MPP), which provided him with temporary assignments and extended leave with disability benefits. The court held that no reasonable fact finder could find that Mr. Kiphart was disabled under the ADA based on the evidence presented at trial. The court found that Mr. Kiphart could not establish that his impairments substantially limited his ability to sleep or work, as required by the ADA definition of disability. The court also found that Mr. Kiphart was not an otherwise qualified individual with a disability because he was unable to perform the essential function of his job, which was to be fully functional and fully rotational.",722567,Monette v.

Electronic Data Systems Corporation, Monette, a customer service representative, claimed that Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS) discriminated against him on the basis of his disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Michigan Handicappers' Civil Rights Act. Monette injured his back and shoulder when a television and video cassette recorder fell off the cart he was pushing. He requested medical leave and received full pay and benefits for seven months. However, when he filed for long-term disability benefits, they were denied, and his pay and benefits ceased. Monette recovered from his injury and returned to work unannounced, but no customer service representative position was available. EDS argued that it had filled Monette's position while he was on medical leave and was informing them that he was unable to perform his job under any circumstances. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of EDS, and Monette appealed. Monette argued that EDS failed to reasonably accommodate his handicap by granting him only thirty-seven days of unpaid leave while they attempted to find a position for him. He also claimed that EDS should have considered him for jobs other than customer service representative or computer technician as a reasonable accommodation. EDS, on the other hand, argued that it reasonably accommodated Monette by placing him on unpaid medical leave for thirty-seven days while it attempted to place him in a new position. The court held that Monette failed to establish that his proposed accommodation was a ""reasonable"" one under the ADA. Monette proposed that EDS should have kept him on unpaid leave indefinitely until another customer service representative or receptionist position opened up. However, employers are not required to keep employees on staff indefinitely in the hope that some position may become available some time in the future. Furthermore, Monette did not propose any alternative accommodation as an alternative. The court also denied Monette's motion to file a second amended complaint, as it believed that Monette would be unable to withstand a motion for summary judgment on his retaliatory discharge claim. The major statute laws applied in this case were the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Michigan Handicappers' Civil Rights Act.","When, as here, a plaintiff presents direct evidence his employer relied on his disability in making an employment decision, he bears the burden of establishing (1) he is “disabled” and (2) he is “otherwise qualified” for the position despite his disability, either with or without reasonable accommodation or with an allegedly “essential” job requirement eliminated. Monette v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1186 (6th Cir.1996). His employer then bears the burden of proving that a challenged job criterion is essential, and therefore a business necessity, or that the proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Id.

The district court found Saturn had reasonably accommodated Kiphart through his participation in the Member Placement Program. Indeed, Saturn admirably found temporary jobs for Kiphart for most of the 1300 days following his removal from his original team. 13 In previous cases cited by the district court, we have held employers have reasonably accommodated employees through far shorter job searches of only thirty-seven and forty days. See Monette, 90 F.3d at 1173; Smith v. Ameritech, 129 F.3d 857, 866 (6th Cir.1997). However, the issue before the Court today is not susceptible to mathematical solution. Rather, we must decide only whether Kiphart presented sufficient evidence to support the jury’s conclusion *587 Saturn failed to reasonably accommodate Kiphart. We believe he did.","Title 42 U.S.C. § 12111 (9)(B) provides that the term reasonable accommodation may include: (B) job structuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities. The EEOC regulations explain that an employer “should reassign the individual to an equivalent position, in terms of pay, status, etc., if the individual is qualified, and if the position is vacant within a reasonable amount of time,” which “should be determined in light of the totality of the circumstances.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 (o), App. (emphasis added). The Sixth Circuit has held that unsuccessful reassignment searches lasting 37 and 40 days amounted to reasonable accommodations. Monette v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173 (6th Cir.1996); Ameritech, 129 F.3d at 866. The Court explained that “employers simply are not required to keep an employee on staff indefinitely in the hope that some position may become available some time in the future.” Monette, 90 F.3d at 1187. In addition to reassignment, paid and unpaid medical leave are also considered reasonable accommodations. Cehrs v. Northeast Ohio Alzheimer’s Research Ctr., 155 F.3d 775, 782 (6th Cir.1998). In order to accommodate Mr. Kiphart, Saturn placed him in the MMP. 18 *782 Through this program, Saturn searched for a permanent placement for him for more than 1,300 days.",Neutral,Positive,"The first citation simply supports the statement of law and the second one is illustrative, without the court clearly saying it was right or wrong (""not susceptible to mathematical solution"")","The citing case (Kiphart v. Saturn Corp.) uses Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corporation to support its reasoning on reasonable accommodation under the ADA. The court cites Monette to establish that employers are not required to keep employees indefinitely while waiting for a suitable position to open up. This is evidenced by the direct quote: 'employers simply are not required to keep an employee on staff indefinitely in the hope that some position may become available some time in the future.' The citing case uses Monette as a benchmark, noting that 37-40 day reassignment searches were considered reasonable accommodations. By comparing Saturn's 1,300-day accommodation effort to Monette's standard, the court implicitly supports its decision that Saturn provided reasonable accommodation.",https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2424551/kiphart-v-saturn-corp/

Kirkeberg, who worked as the Administrator of Employee Assistance Programs for CPR, became legally blind in one eye due to a central retinal vein occlusion and later disclosed his hepatitis C diagnosis to his supervisor. He requested accommodations, including working from home, but was denied. After a break-in at CPR, Kirkeberg's computer was stolen, and he believed it would not have been stolen if he had been allowed to work from home.

However, the court found that Kirkeberg failed to present sufficient evidence to show that his conditions substantially limited these major life activities.

Keane, who suffered from neuropathy, requested accommodations such as using a shortcut through the shoe stockroom and parking in a reserved space near her department. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Sears, concluding that Keane was not disabled under the ADA and that she could not establish any of the elements of her failure to accommodate claim. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether Keane was disabled and whether Sears failed to engage in the interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations. The court found that Keane's neuropathy substantially limited her ability to walk, as defined by the ADA, and that Sears was aware of her disability and her requests for accommodations. The court also criticized Sears for failing to engage in the interactive process in good faith. Sears had denied Keane's requests for accommodations without offering alternatives or explaining why they were unreasonable.

She also contended that she was otherwise qualified for her job as a Dietary Services Manager and that Care Initiatives knew of her disability and forced her departure because of it.

The company, on the other hand, claimed that Lewis was dismissed due to an outburst at work, during which she allegedly yelled, used profanity, and criticized her supervisors. The case went to trial, and the district court instructed the jury that Lewis could prevail only if she showed that her disability was the ""sole reason"" for the company's decision to terminate her employment. The jury ruled in favor of the company. The Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred in instructing the jury to use the ""sole reason"" standard, as this standard is not required by the text of the ADA.

The district court granted Ajilon summary judgment on both claims, finding that Cotter failed to provide sufficient evidence that he was either actually or regarded as disabled. Cotter began working for Ajilon in 1993 as a technically-skilled employee and was placed with various client employers. In 1993, he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, an intestinal ailment that can be controlled with medication, diet, exercise, and rest. Cotter notified his supervisor of his doctor's recommendation to limit overtime work due to his condition. In 1994, Bachleda, Cotter's supervisor, asked him to take on continuous overtime work with Chrysler, and threatened termination if he refused. Cotter suffered a flare-up of his colitis and took leave, during which Bachleda told him he had lost his Blue Cross position and that Ajilon would terminate him if he lost another position. To state a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that they are an individual with a disability, are otherwise qualified to perform the job requirements, and were discharged solely by reason of their handicap. The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The district court found that Cotter was not substantially limited in his ability to work because he found a similar job after termination and had worked continuously without taking time off due to his colitis. Cotter also argued that Ajilon regarded him as disabled, but the district court dismissed this claim, stating that he had not offered sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ajilon believed his colitis significantly restricted him from performing a class or broad range of jobs.","Consistent with Maddox, we used the “solely” standard in an ADA-only claim a year later, Monette v.

(BNA) 389 | 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 10618 | 2012 WL 1889389,"In the case of Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp., the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals considered the standard for causation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The plaintiff, Susan Lewis, argued that the company dismissed her from her position as a registered nurse because of her disability, which made it difficult for her to walk and required her to use a wheelchair at times. The company, on the other hand, claimed that Lewis was dismissed due to an outburst at work, during which she allegedly yelled, used profanity, and criticized her supervisors. The case went to trial, and the district court instructed the jury that Lewis could prevail only if she showed that her disability was the ""sole reason"" for the company's decision to terminate her employment. The jury ruled in favor of the company. The Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred in instructing the jury to use the ""sole reason"" standard, as this standard is not required by the text of the ADA. The court explained that the ADA prohibits discrimination ""because of"" a person's disability, and that this language does not require the employee to show that disability was the ""sole cause"" of the adverse employment action. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the ADA should adopt the ""motivating factor"" standard used in Title VII cases, as the ADA and Title VII have distinct causation standards. The court noted that the ADA's text does not include the ""motivating factor"" language, and that the two statutes have different causation standards. The court remanded the case for a new trial, instructing the district court to use the ""because of"" standard for causation under the ADA.

Macy alleged that the Board violated federal and state law by firing her because of her disability and in retaliation for protected activities. The Board argued that Macy was fired for threatening students and making inappropriate remarks, which were not pretextual. The court held that Macy had not presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute at each stage of the McDonnell Douglas inquiry for her ADA discrimination claim. Although Macy argued that the Board's proffered reason had no basis in fact, was not the actual motivating factor, or was insufficient to motivate the decision to fire her, the court found that issue preclusion applied due to Macy's prior criminal conviction and administrative hearing determination that she had threatened students and made inappropriate remarks. Macy's retaliation claims and state-law claims were forfeited because she did not develop them on appeal.

Chertoff, Plaintiff Ann Marie Mogenhan brought a lawsuit against Defendant Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, alleging gender and disability discrimination, retaliation, and failure to accommodate under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The case came before the court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff argued that she was subjected to gender discrimination through lower performance appraisals and unequal treatment by her supervisor, as well as retaliation for engaging in Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) activities. She also claimed that the USSS failed to accommodate her disability, heat-triggered migraine headaches, and that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on her gender, disability, and retaliation. Defendant argued that Plaintiff could not establish an adverse employment action for her gender discrimination claim, as her performance appraisals and general allegations of mistreatment did not meet the legal standard for adverse actions. Defendant also contended that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a causal relationship between her EEO activities and any adverse employment actions. Regarding the hostile work environment claim, Defendant argued that none of the alleged incidents gave rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of gender, disability, or retaliation. The court held that Plaintiff could not make a prima facie case for her gender discrimination claim because she could not demonstrate an adverse employment action. The court also found that Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case for her retaliation claim due to the lack of an adverse employment action. The court further determined that Plaintiff's allegations of a hostile work environment did not meet the legal standard for a hostile work environment under Title VII.

Choate, the plaintiff, Jeffrey Webb, a psychologist with severe asthma, osteoporosis, and a weakened immune system, argued that the defendant, Clyde L. Choate Mental Health and Development Center, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to reasonably accommodate his disabilities and terminating his employment. Webb requested accommodations such as a well-ventilated office, adherence to job position duties, an immediately accessible, lockable storage unit for medication, and exemption from intentional contact with patients known to be violent and/or have infectious conditions. The defendant argued that it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal, as Webb had voluntarily dismissed his appeal and then reinstated it after the deadline. Choate also contended that it had reasonably accommodated Webb by granting six of his eight requests and that his remaining requests were not reasonable under the ADA. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal, despite Choate's argument to the contrary. The court found that Webb's conditions did not substantially limit his employment as a psychologist generally, as he had not presented evidence that his impairments prevented him from holding other comparable positions. Therefore, Webb was not a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA. The court also determined that Webb's request for exemption from intentional contact with known violent and/or infectious patients was not a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. The court noted that the position of Psychologist I at Choate required direct interaction with violent and/or infectious patients and that Webb's request to restructure his position in this way was unreasonable.

JEFFBOAT, LLC, the plaintiff, James Ragan, brought a disability discrimination claim against his former employer under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Ragan alleged that Jeffboat failed to make reasonable accommodations for his back condition, which substantially limited him in the major life activities of walking and working, or mistakenly regarded him as disabled and disqualified him from work based on erroneous perceptions. The court granted Jeffboat's motion for summary judgment on Ragan's failure-to-accommodate claim, as Ragan failed to present sufficient evidence that he was a qualified individual with a disability who was otherwise able to perform the essential functions of his job with or without accommodation. The court found that Ragan's walking and working abilities were not substantially limited, as he was not restricted from walking on flat surfaces or performing all of the essential functions of his job. However, the court denied Jeffboat's motion for summary judgment on Ragan's regarded-as claim. Ragan presented evidence that Jeffboat disqualified him from a wide range of jobs for a lengthy period of time, despite his successful performance of his original job for seven years without accommodation. The court found that a jury could reasonably conclude that Jeffboat erroneously regarded Ragan as unable to perform a wide range of jobs in various classes, raising an inference of discrimination.

Ford contended that Amadio was unable to perform the essential functions of his job due to his extended absences and poor attendance record. The company argued that Amadio failed to comply with its sick leave policy and that his termination was not based on his disability but on his attendance record. The court held that Amadio failed to establish the first element of a prima facie case under the ADA, as he could not prove that he was a qualified individual with a disability. The court found that Amadio did not provide sufficient evidence to show that he had a disability, could perform the essential functions of his employment position, or that reasonable accommodations would have allowed him to perform those functions.

Vilsack, Clarice Sanchez, a long-time Forest Service employee, suffered irreversible brain damage after falling at work, resulting in a permanent vision impairment. Sanchez requested a hardship transfer to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for medical treatment and support from her family and friends. The Forest Service denied her request and Sanchez filed a lawsuit under the Rehabilitation Act, alleging discrimination and a hostile work environment. Sanchez argued that her vision impairment substantially limited her major life activity of seeing and qualified as a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. The Forest Service countered that Sanchez was not substantially limited in her ability to see and that transfer accommodations were not required by the Act. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Sanchez had raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding her disability. The court found that Sanchez's vision impairment significantly limited her ability to see as compared to the average person, and that she had presented evidence of the challenges it caused in her daily life. The court also rejected the Forest Service's argument that transfer accommodations were not required by the Rehabilitation Act. The court noted that the Act requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, including reassignment to a vacant position if the employee is qualified for the job and it does not impose an undue burden on the employer. The court further held that accommodations may be required to allow an employee to pursue therapy or treatment for their disability or to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.

United Air Lines, Inc., Plaintiffs, twin sisters and commercial airline pilots for regional commuter aires, alleged that United discriminated against them in the hiring process for major airline pilot positions due to their uncorrected vision, which disqualified them based on the airline's requirement of uncorrected vision of 20/100 or better. Plaintiffs argued they were disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) because their vision substantially limited their major life activity of seeing and United regarded them as having a substantially limiting impairment. The court held that Plaintiffs' uncorrected vision was a physical impairment under the ADA, but they could not establish that it substantially limited their major life activity of seeing when taking into account mitigating measures such as corrective lenses. The court also found that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that United regarded them as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, as they were not disqualified from all pilot positions but only from those requiring uncorrected vision of 20/100 or better. Major statute law applied: Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) and Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.).","In Sutton v.

Congress amended the ADA in 2008 ""to correct what it viewed as an overly restrictive interpretation of the statute’s terms” in Sutton. Carter, 662 F.3d at 1144 (quotation and citations omitted); see .ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553. Because the ADA Amendments Act does not operate retroactively, however, ""we apply the law as it stood prior to the enactment.” Carter, 662 F.3d at 1144. .","To prove that she is disabled, Sanchez must: (1) have a recognized impairment; (2) identify one or more appropriate major life activities; and (3) show that the impairment substantially limits one or more of those activities. Doebele v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 342 F.3d 1117, 1129 (10th Cir. 2003). “Whether a plaintiff has met the first two requirements are questions of law for the court. But whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.” Carter v. Pathfinder Energy Servs., Inc., 662 F.3d 1134, 1142 (10th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). There is no dispute that Sanchez has a recognized impairment or that the life activity she has identified—seeing—falls within the Act. See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 130 F.3d 893, 900 (10th Cir. 1997) (defining “major life activity” to include “seeing”); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i) (same). We thus focus on whether Sanchez has demonstrated at least a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether her condition “substantially limits” her ability to see. We conclude that she has done so. An impairment is substantially limiting when it renders an individual significantly restricted in her ability to perform a major life activity “compared to the average person -6in the general population.” Johnson v.

(CCH) 45,619","The plaintiff, a diesel mechanic, alleges discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) after being terminated from his job following shoulder surgery and subsequent restrictions. The defendant, SW Rodgers, Co., Inc., moved to dismiss the complaint. The court held that the plaintiff's allegations of a rotator cuff injury do not automatically exclude ADA coverage, as the determination of disability is case-by-case. However, the court found that the complaint failed to adequately allege that the plaintiff's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The court also found that the plaintiff's FMLA claims were timely due to the allegation of willful violations, and that the Commission's findings of fact regarding the reason for the plaintiff's termination do not preclude his claims of retaliation under the ADA and FMLA. The court dismissed the claims for punitive damages and emotional distress damages under the FMLA as not allowed by the statute. Key arguments of the plaintiff: The plaintiff alleged that he suffered from a disabling rotator cuff injury, was denied reasonable accommodations, and was terminated in retaliation for exercising his rights under the ADA and FMLA. Key arguments of the defendant: The defendant argued that the plaintiff's rotator cuff injury was not a disabling impairment under the ADA, that the plaintiff failed to adequately allege willful violations of the FMLA, and that the Commission's findings of fact regarding the reason for the plaintiff's termination precluded his claims of retaliation. Court's conclusion: The court dismissed the claim for discrimination under the ADA without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to file an amended complaint. The court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the FMLA claims in all other respects.

Ingalls Shipbuilding, Tamela J. Dutcher appealed a summary judgment ruling in her favor under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), alleging that her former employer, Ingalls Shipbuilding, denied her reinstatement due to her impaired arm. Dutcher sustained a gunshot injury in 1989 and began working as a welder for Ingalls in 1991, initially assigned to a position requiring significant climbing. She requested a transfer to a position without climbing due to her arm injury but was denied due to insufficient seniority. Dutcher continued to work in the climbing position until she was laid off in 1992. When she was recalled in 1992, she was denied reinstatement due to her inability to climb. Dutcher argued that her impairment substantially limited her ability to perform the major life activity of working, as she could not perform a class of jobs that required climbing. However, the court found that her injury only affected her ability to perform a narrow range of jobs and did not substantially limit her ability to work in general. Dutcher also argued that Ingalls regarded her as having a disability, but the court found that there was no evidence to support this claim, as Ingalls continued to employ her as a non-climbing welder after her initial transfer and denied her reinstatement solely because she could not climb. Major statute law applied: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101-12213), Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 701-797), and the regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under the ADA (29 C.F.R. § 1630).",,"Defendant's cited authority is not to the contrary; those decisions do not hold that shoulder injuries are per se not disabling under the ADA.' Rather, they each conclude, on the basis of a summary judgment record, that a particular claimant's particular shoulder injury is not a disabling impairment. See, e.g., Freund v. Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc., 930 F.Supp. 613, 618 (S.D.Ga.1996) (plaintiff failed to establish at summary judgment that Her shoulder injury substantially limited a major life activity); Otis v.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Title VII, and Puerto Rico state laws Law 80, Law 44, and Law 100. Torres-Almán claimed discrimination based on age and disability, denial of reasonable accommodation, retaliation, and violation of her civil rights. Defendant Axesa moved for summary judgment on all of Torres-Almán's claims. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. Torres-Almán's disability discrimination claims under the ADA failed because she could not establish that her breast cancer condition substantially limited her major life activities. Although breast cancer is an impairment, it does not automatically render an individual disabled under the ADA. The court found that Torres-Almán's breast cancer did not substantially limit her ability to perform her job functions, and she was able to continue working during her treatment. Torres-Almán's reasonable accommodation claims also failed because she could not establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must prove that they are disabled, able to perform the essential functions of their job, and that the adverse employment action was based on their disability. Torres-Almán could not meet the first prong of this test because her breast cancer did not substantially limit her major life activities. Torres-Almán's association discrimination claims under the ADA also failed because the ADA does not provide a cause of action for non-disabled employees who are associates of disabled individuals. The ADA only protects individuals with disabilities from discrimination. Torres-Almán's ADEA claims also failed because she could not establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.",2309309,Bankston v. Chertoff,2006-11-09T00:00:00.000000000+00:00,460 F.

He also claimed constitutional violations and torts. The defendants, including Michael Chertoff in his official capacity as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, contended that Bankston failed to establish a prima facie case for sex discrimination as he was not treated differently than similarly-situated persons of the opposite sex. They also argued that Bankston did not meet the requirements for age discrimination as he was not forty years old at the time of his reassignment or termination. Regarding disability discrimination, the defendants asserted that Bankston failed to prove that his disabilities substantially limited his major life activities. The defendants also denied Bankston's retaliation claims, stating that they were not aware of his protected activity prior to his termination. The court held that Bankston failed to set forth a prima facie case of sex discrimination as he could not establish that he was treated differently than similarly-situated persons of the opposite sex. The court also found that Bankston's age, disability discrimination, and retaliation claims failed as a matter of law due to insufficient evidence. The court dismissed Bankston's hostile work environment claim because he did not claim the alleged harassment was based on a protected characteristic. The court also found that Bankston's First Amendment claim and tort claims failed as they were not presented to the appropriate federal agency before filing the lawsuit.

See Riverctr-Diaz v. Executive Airlines, 413 F.Supp.2d 36, 41 (D.P.R.2006) (“The plaintiff will not be able to establish a prima facie case under the ADEA, because the uncontested facts show that the plaintiff was thirty-nine years old at the time she was terminated from Executive Airlines.

City of Missouri City, Way, a lawyer employed by the City from August 2018 to January 2021, brought claims against the City under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA). The district court granted the City summary judgment on all claims. On appeal, Way argued that she was discriminated against and retaliated against due to her anxiety and fibroids, which substantially limited her major life activities, and that the City interfered with her FMLA leave and retaliated against her for taking FMLA leave. The City argued that it was not a covered entity under the ADA and TCHRA, and that Way failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. The City also contended that it did not interfere with Way's FMLA leave or retaliate against her for taking leave. The court held that the City was a covered entity under the ADA and TCHRA, and that Way made a prima facie case of discrimination and retaliation based on her anxiety. However, the court found that Way failed to establish a causal link between her protected activities and the adverse employment actions taken by the City. The court also held that Way did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation based on her fibroids, as she did not request accommodations for that condition until after her termination. The court further held that the City did not interfere with Way's FMLA leave or retaliate against her for taking leave. The court found that Way did not suffer any prejudice as a result of the City's misclassification of her leave, as both administrative leave and FMLA leave are unpaid.

Liberty Life Insurance, the plaintiff, Ray Daigle, appealed the district court's judgment in his discrimination suit against his former employer, Liberty Life Insurance Company. Daigle claimed that Liberty discriminated against him based on his learning disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Liberty argued that Daigle was terminated due to his mistreatment of employees and dishonesty. At trial, conflicting evidence was presented regarding both parties' positions. The jury found that Daigle had not proven that his termination was due to a disability or that Liberty's proffered reason for the termination was a pretense for discrimination. Daigle appealed the judgment, arguing that Liberty failed to present any evidence to create a disputed fact issue as to the existence of his disability. The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability in regard to employment. A plaintiff can establish a claim of disability discrimination by presenting direct evidence or using the McDonnell Douglas analysis, which requires showing that the plaintiff suffers from a disability, is qualified for the job, was subject to an adverse employment action, and was replaced by a non-disabled person or treated less favorably than non-disabled employees. Once the plaintiff has stated a prima facie case, the employer must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action. Daigle argued that the district court erred in denying his motion for partial summary judgment because Liberty failed to present any evidence to create a disputed fact issue as to the existence of his disability. However, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that it would focus on the evidence before the jury at trial instead of the evidence before the judge during pretrial activities.

In Williamson v. American National Insurance Company, a pro se plaintiff, Jeffrey Alan Williamson, brought employment discrimination claims against his former employer, ANICO, under both state and federal law, seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief. The case involved allegations of disability discrimination and retaliation. At the summary judgment stage, ANICO argued that Williamson failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing his lawsuit and that his claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that Williamson had not exhausted his administrative remedies as required by law and dismissed his claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Major statute law applied: 1. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.) 2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) 3. Texas Labor Code (Chapter 21) Key arguments of the parties: Plaintiff (Williamson): 1. Discrimination based on disability: Williamson alleged that he was a qualified individual with a disability and was subjected to discrimination based on his disability during his employment with ANICO. 2. Retaliation: Williamson claimed that he was retaliated against for engaging in protected activities, including filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and requesting reasonable accommodations. Defendant (ANICO): 1. Failure to exhaust administrative remedies: ANICO argued that Williamson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing his lawsuit, as required by both federal and state law. 2. Statute of limitations: ANICO contended that Williamson's claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Court's conclusion: The court held that Williamson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing his lawsuit and dismissed his claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

The second part of the opinion text is summarized as follows:
In Williamson v. American National Insurance Company, the plaintiff, Jeffrey Alan Williamson, a pro se employee, alleged discrimination based on disability under Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA). He claimed that his employer, ANICO, terminated him due to his seizures and impairments, and denied him reasonable accommodations. ANICO argued that Williamson failed to demonstrate a claim under any cause of action and that he was terminated as part of a reduction-in-force. The court held that Williamson's complaint was vague, conclusory, and spare, with limited factual allegations. The court assumed for the purposes of the summary judgment that Ciaccio, Williamson's supervisor during rehabilitation, was a supervisor during his rehabilitation at this stage of litigation. However, the court found that the accusations against Sarah Sparks were few, unclear, and not materially related to Williamson's alleged employment discrimination based on his disability. The court further held that only an employer can be liable under Title VII, and that immediate supervisors can be considered employers when they have been delegated the employer's traditional rights or participate in the decision-making process that forms the basis of the discrimination. The court also noted that a supervisor or employee cannot be held liable in their individual capacity under Title VII or the ADA. Major statute law applied: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.), and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA) (Texas Labor Code, § 21.051 et seq.).",6453,Grant v.

Murray contested the judgment against him in his individual capacity for backpay damages under title VII, arguing that the statute does not allow for such liability against individuals who do not qualify as employers. The court agreed, stating that title VII defines an ""employer"" as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce with fifteen or more employees, and individuals do not meet this definition. The court also noted that the structure of title VII, including the types of damages available and the parties subject to liability, indicates that Congress did not intend for natural persons who are not employers to be held liable for backpay damages. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment against Murray and rendered judgment in favor of Lone Star Company.

Garland, the plaintiff, a former federal attorney, challenged the district court's fee award of $170,331.56 in attorneys' fees, arguing that it did not reasonably compensate his attorney for her time. The case arose from a Title VII employment discrimination dispute, and the plaintiff's attorney had spent over 1,200 hours on the case. The district court used the lodestar method to calculate the fee award, setting Attorney Almodóvar's hourly rate at $275 for core legal work and $165 for non-core work. The plaintiff challenged several rulings made by the district court in constructing the fee award, including the exclusion of time spent on settlement negotiations and time spent on work connected to other cases. The First Circuit held that the district court erred in categorically excluding time spent on settlement negotiations from the lodestar calculation. The court reasoned that settlement negotiations are an essential part of civil rights cases and should be compensable as long as they are reasonable and productive. The court also held that the district court erred in excluding time spent on work connected to other cases if that work was useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to secure the final result obtained from the litigation. The court remanded the case for further proceedings, allowing credit for all time reasonably spent by the plaintiff's counsel during the course of settlement negotiations and in performing useful and ordinarily necessary work in connection with other cases.

The court of appeals held that McDonnell Douglas and its burden-shifting framework do not apply in assessing post-trial JMOL motions, and that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for a rational jury to find that Barrett suffered unlawful retaliation. The court also upheld the district court's award of attorney fees for the trial, but vacated the award for fees incurred during the administrative grievance process, as those were not required under Title VII. Key arguments: - Barrett argued that he was retaliated against for helping a colleague file a sexual harassment complaint and presented evidence of protected activity, adverse employment action, and a causal link between the two. - Salt Lake County argued that Barrett did not prove various elements required to make out a prima facie case of retaliation and sought judgment as a matter of law.

There, the court decided that the useful-and-necessary standard does not apply to actions under Title VII. See id. at 870-71; cf. Binta B. ex rel. S.A. v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 608, 631 (6th Cir. 2013) (“[W]e are troubled by the idea of ever permitting plaintiffs' counsel to receive fees for work performed in a completely separate case.”).

We do not agree. To determine “the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation,” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, an inquiring court must look not to labels but, rather, to the nature of the work and its utility to the case at hand, see Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 561, 106 S.Ct. 3088. That “look” is not constrained by the four corners of the particular case. See Nat'l Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec'y of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1335 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Instead, a court should award fees for all hours logged in connection with work that is “‘useful and of a type ordinarily necessary’ to secure the final result obtained from the litigation.” Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 561, 106 S.Ct. 3088 (quoting Webb v. Bd. of Educ., 471 U.S. 234, 243, 105 S.Ct. 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 233 (1985)); see Hutchinson ex rel. Julien v. Patrick, 636 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2011). This standard controls even when that work implicates some other case. See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de P.R., 187 F.3d 30, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (applying the “useful and of a type ordinarily necessary” standard to “work done in the [Puerto Rico] courts before the filing of the federal lawsuit”).","Even though the district court ""acknowledge[d] that the strength vel non of Plaintiff's testimony in those cases weighed directly on [his] ability to secure a settlement in the instant case,"" it nonetheless concluded — as a categorical matter — that ""work done in one case is not properly recovered in a distinct case under a fee-shifting statute."" The district court's view is not without some support in the case law. In Barrett v. Salt Lake County, the Tenth Circuit held that a prevailing Title VII plaintiff may not recover attorneys' fees for time spent in navigating the employer's optional grievance process even if such work was ""useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to secure the final result obtained from the litigation."" 754 F.3d 864, 870 (10th Cir. 2014) (internal - 14 - quotations omitted) (quoting Pennsylvania v.

Vilsack, Clarice Sanchez, a long-time Forest Service employee, suffered irreversible brain damage after falling at work, resulting in a permanent vision impairment. Sanchez requested a hardship transfer to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for medical treatment and support from her family and friends. The Forest Service denied her request and Sanchez filed a lawsuit under the Rehabilitation Act, alleging discrimination and a hostile work environment. Sanchez argued that her vision impairment substantially limited her major life activity of seeing and qualified as a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. The Forest Service countered that Sanchez was not substantially limited in her ability to see and that transfer accommodations were not required by the Act. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Sanchez had raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding her disability. The court found that Sanchez's vision impairment significantly limited her ability to see as compared to the average person, and that she had presented evidence of the challenges it caused in her daily life. The court also rejected the Forest Service's argument that transfer accommodations were not required by the Rehabilitation Act. The court noted that the Act requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, including reassignment to a vacant position if the employee is qualified for the job and it does not impose an undue burden on the employer. The court further held that accommodations may be required to allow an employee to pursue therapy or treatment for their disability or to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.

The USPS had assigned Woodman to various jobs due to her injuries, but she contended that these assignments did not meet her medical restrictions and constituted discrimination. The district court granted the USPS's motion for summary judgment, and Woodman appealed. Woodman argued that she is a qualified individual with a disability, that the USPS failed to reasonably accommodate her disability by providing her with a permanent job assignment within her medical limitations, and that such failure constituted discrimination on the basis of disability. The USPS argued that Woodman was not a qualified individual due to her inability to perform the essential functions of her previous job, and that it had no duty to reassign her to a permanent position as there was no funded vacant position available within her craft, work facility, and work hours consistent with her medical restrictions. The court held that there were genuine issues of material fact precluding judgment as a matter of law. Woodman had provided evidence that she could be reasonably accommodated with a permanent assignment to consumer affairs, and the USPS had not shown that such reassignment would be inconsistent with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The court also noted that the USPS had a duty to investigate the possibility of permanent reassignment and had not met this obligation.

Principi, Fred McGeshick appealed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in McGeshick's claim of employment discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. McGeshick had applied for a housekeeping aid position at the Albuquerque VA Medical Center but was denied due to concerns about his safety in performing the job's manual labor requirements, specifically his ability to work on ladders and in stairwells, given his diagnosis of Meniere's disease and associated symptoms. McGeshick argued that he was perceived as disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act and entitled to summary judgment. The Secretary argued that McGeshick had not presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, as he had not shown that the VA perceived him as disabled in the broader sense of the term under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Secretary also maintained that McGeshick was not otherwise qualified for the position due to the safety concerns. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision. The court held that McGeshick had not presented evidence that the VA perceived him as disabled under the Rehabilitation Act, as his evidence focused only on the specific concerns about his ability to perform the tasks associated with the housekeeping aid position. The court noted that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA define disability differently, and McGeshick had not shown that his Meniere's disease substantially limited him in major life activities beyond the scope of the job in question.

The Ninth Circuit, affirming, held that Title II does not apply to employment based on the statutory text and context, as well as the structure of the ADA as a whole.

The court held that the workers' compensation release did not bar Bledsoe's federal claims, as the release language did not mention a waiver of federal discrimination claims and there was no evidence of consideration given in exchange for the waiver.

University of Maryland Medical System Corporation, Dr. Doe, an HIV-positive neurosurgical resident, brought a lawsuit against UMMSC for discrimination under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). UMMSC terminated Dr. Doe's residency due to the risk of HIV transmission during exposure-prone procedures. The district court granted summary judgment to UMMSC, and Dr. Doe appealed. Dr. Doe argued that he was an otherwise qualified individual with a disability under both statutes, as he was qualified for the residency before his HIV diagnosis and was not a significant risk to the health or safety of patients that could not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation. UMMSC countered that HIV poses a significant risk due to its transmissibility via blood-to-blood contact, the fact that Dr. Doe will always be infectious, and the potential severity of harm to third parties. The court applied the Arline test, which considers the nature, duration, severity, and probabilities of the risk. The court held that Dr. Doe did pose a significant risk due to the types of procedures he was engaged in as a neurosurgical resident and the impossibility of eliminating the risk of percutaneous injury through reasonable accommodation. Dr. Doe also argued that UMMSC's differential treatment of HIV-positive HCWs based on whether their status was known violated the Equal Protection Clause.

Serv. 1954 | 99 Daily Journal DAR 2533 | 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 4359 | 1999 WL 144112,"Plaintiff, Scot L. Zimmerman, brought an action against the State of Oregon Department of Justice (Defendant) claiming discrimination in employment in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and a similar state anti-discrimination statute. The district court dismissed the Title II claim, holding that it does not apply to employment. On appeal, Plaintiff argues that the court erred in this interpretation. The Ninth Circuit, affirming, held that Title II does not apply to employment based on the statutory text and context, as well as the structure of the ADA as a whole. Key arguments of the parties: Plaintiff argued that Title II's broad language and the Attorney General's regulation under Chevron deference should apply to employment discrimination. Defendant argued that the plain language of Title II and the structure of the ADA demonstrate that Congress did not intend for Title II to apply to employment. Court's conclusion: The Ninth Circuit held that Title II does not apply to employment based on the statutory text and context, as well as the structure of the ADA as a whole. Major statute law being applied: 1. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. 2. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. 3.

LEXIS 20749 | 1998 WL 954876,"In Alberti v. City & County of San Francisco Sheriff's Department, the plaintiff, Robert Alberti, a person with learning disabilities, brought an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) action against the defendants for employment discrimination and harassment. Alberti argued that Title II of the ADA covers employment discrimination, while defendants contended that it does not and that Alberti failed to exhaust administrative remedies for his Title I and Title II claims. The court began by examining whether Title II covers employment discrimination. Alberti argued that Title II's broad language, which prohibits discrimination ""by any such entity,"" includes employment discrimination. Defendants countered that the absence of the word ""employment"" in the statute indicates that it does not apply to employment discrimination. The court found that Title II's legislative history and the Department of Justice's interpretation support Alberti's argument. Regarding the timeliness of Alberti's claims, the court held that a one-year statute of limitations applies to Title II claims based on California personal injury law. Alberti filed his Title II complaint with the Department of Justice (DOJ) within one year of the alleged discrimination but did not receive a right-to-sue letter until after the two-year delay in the DOJ's handling of his complaint. The court applied the doctrine of equitable tolling and found that Alberti met the three-prong test for invoking equitable tolling. The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss Alberti's Title I claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. However, it granted Alberti leave to amend his Title II complaint to allege equitable tolling. The court dismissed Alberti's FEHA claims due to his failure to exhaust administrative remedies, as the jurisdictional requirement of exhaustion is not waivable. Major statute law applied: Title I and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Cal. Gov’t Code § 12940 et seq.).","We are mindful that most courts have held that Title II applies to employment. Ordinarily, we would find it difficult to hold that the wording of a statute unambiguously indicates a contrary congressional intent in the face of such precedent. However, those courts generally have ignored the wording of Title II altogether,[fn11] including the definition of ""qualified individual with a disability"" from that Title and the surrounding words in 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Instead, they have: (1) assumed without analysis that Title II applies to employment,[fn12] (2) relied only on the Attorney General's regulation and the legislative history of the ADA, without discussion of the statutory text and context,[fn13] (3) relied on the Rehabilitation Act without analyzing whether Congress intended to incorporate its prohibition against employment discrimination
into Title II,[fn14] or (4) relied solely on the foregoing precedent without independent consideration of the problem.[fn15] Because of the limited analysis performed in those cases —
in particular, their failure to consider the statutory text and context carefully — we simply do not find them persuasive.","Palm Beach County Soil & Water Conservation Dist., 133 F.3d 816, 822 (11th cir.) (""[T]he language of Title II's antidiscrimination provision does not limit the ADA's coverage to conduct that occurs in the `programs, services, or activities,' of [a public entity]. Rather, it is a catch-all phrase that prohibits all discrimination by a public entity, regardless of the context."")

Under that interpretation, Title II would be broad enough to include employment discrimination by a public entity.

Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 631-34, 104 S.Ct. 1248, 79 L.Ed.2d 568 (1984). Plaintiff and amicus argue that we must interpret Title II, likewise, to apply to employment. See, e.g., Bledsoe, 133 F.3d at 821 (“It is significant that Congress intended Title II to work in the same manner as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, because Section 504 was so focused on employment discrimination that Congress enacted subsequent legislation to clarify that Section 504 applied to other forms of discrimination in addition to employment discrimination.”) (citing Consolidated Rail, 465 U.S. at 626-32, 104 S.Ct. 1248 ); Alberti, 32 F.Supp.2d 1164, -, 1998 WL 954876, at *5 (“Congress modeled Title II of the ADA after the Rehabilitation Act....

(BNA) 447 | 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10466 | 1998 WL 388886,"In Downs v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Downs, a job applicant, sued his former employer, the MBTA, for wrongful termination after being fired following the discovery of false answers he had given during a pre-employment medical examination. Downs argued that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act prohibited the MBTA from asking questions regarding his prior workers' compensation claims and disability status, and that the MBTA violated confidentiality requirements imposed by these statutes. The MBTA moved for summary judgment, arguing that Title II of the ADA and Title I of the ADA did not apply to employment discrimination claims, and that Downs failed to file a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Downs replied to an MBTA advertisement in 1989 and underwent a two-part preliminary screening process, including a driver's test and a personality inventory. After passing these examinations, he was invited for a physical examination and a conditional offer of employment. During the medical examination, Downs answered negatively to questions regarding his workers' compensation history and joint pains, despite having received workers' compensation for elbow injuries in the past. The MBTA discovered these false answers when evaluating a later workers' compensation claim and terminated Downs for falsifying information on his employment application. The court held that Title II of the ADA applies to employment discrimination claims and that the MBTA's arguments regarding the procedural requirements of Title I and the timeliness of Downs's EEOC charge were without merit. The court also rejected the MBTA's contention that Downs's false answers to medical inquiries prevented him from pursuing his claims, as the MBTA had violated the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by asking impermissible questions during the pre-employment medical examination. Major statute law applied: Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.) and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12111 et seq.) and the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794).","We are mindful that most courts have held that Title II applies to employment.

We do not, however, agree with that interpretation for two reasons: (1) it takes the key phrase out of context, and (2) it conflicts with Ninth Circuit precedent.
